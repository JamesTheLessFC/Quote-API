"Quote API" is an application that allows users to fetch a random quote, fetch all quotes listed in the database, fetch quotes by author, and post quotes. This is a Codecademy project so credit for the idea goes to them, however, the code was written by me. Beyond the scope of the project, I added several new functionalities: updating quotes, deleting quotes, displaying a year for each quote, displaying bios (via fetch) for each author when the user clicks on a 'read bio' button, updating bios, posting bios, and deleting bios.
